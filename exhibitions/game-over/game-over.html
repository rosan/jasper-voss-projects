			<p>‘GAME OVER: Play On’ is a group exhibition that brings together new and existing works around the theme of games and play.  The artists harness existing formats of games and sports, using them to present a narrative, or encouraging the viewers to work together or compete. </p>

			<p>In ‘Life in the Cosmic Bush’, Victoria Grenier traces a single narrative through the animated character of an anthropomorphic beaked mammal. We follow her on a flattened journey through a fantasy platform game world, yet her dialogue presents a far from disembodied existence.</p>

			<p>For Dickon Drury painting is like stepping through a looking glass or a wardrobe. He considers it “another world, a place to have fun in, a dimension where time doesn't apply, like a 'Twilight-Zone' or 'Neverland'. It can be populated with any object, character or motif the artist chooses. Painting is a fantastic playground, where fiction and illusion can run riot: a carnivalesque alternative-reality, yet unceasingly tethered to the physical world by the materials with which it is constructed.”</p>

			<p>Christopher Lawrence becomes a glue-handed wall-climber in ‘Fools Rush In,' training towards a hopelessly sublime fate.</p>

			<p>An invitation to play table tennis is used to subvert the Camden Bench (described as the perfect ‘anti-object’) in Chris Alton's ‘a shared interest in the bounce’. This light-hearted and open-ended game, in which several players may collaborate, considers how so-called 'anti-social behaviours' are deflected from public space. It is perhaps poignant that such a sport should be the invitation; the Victorian parlour game has recently experienced a resurgence, becoming a regular fixture across London. Through this friction, Alton asks us to consider; 'what is acceptable behaviour?', 'where?' and 'why?'.</p>

			<p>Phoebe Baines also interrogates ownership, competition, entertainment and success through her participatory work ‘May The Best Man Win’, in which the audience are invited to compete against one and other to gather as many silicone poker chips as possible to win. Exploring the physiological influences in gambling and all types of sports and games, ‘May The Best Man Win’ highlights the notion that the house always wins, through its deliberately frustrating function. Could this be an allegory for the contemporary ‘art world’, and a wider political climate?</p>
 
			<p>‘GAME OVER: Play On’ is the first in a series of exhibitions curated by Jasper Voss Projects, an itinerant curatorial programme exhibiting emerging artists.</br>
